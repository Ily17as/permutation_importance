# Permutation Importance: An Example Using the Breast Cancer Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of **Permutation Importance**, a model-agnostic technique to evaluate the importance of input features in machine learning models. It showcases how this method can be applied to the **Breast Cancer Dataset** to interpret feature contributions.

## Overview

Permutation Importance is a simple yet effective method for estimating the importance of individual features in a predictive model. By randomly shuffling the values of a feature and observing the impact on model performance, we can determine how much that feature contributes to the model's predictions.

### Key Features
- **Model-Agnostic**: Can be applied to any machine learning model.
- **Breast Cancer Dataset**: A widely-used dataset for binary classification tasks.
- **Feature Importance Evaluation**: Understand which features are most critical for prediction accuracy.
